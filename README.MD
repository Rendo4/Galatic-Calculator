#### By _**{Ryan Rendon}**_

## Description

This project will take an inputted age and calculate how old they are in years on other planets. A year will be defined as a full orbit around the sun (example earth: 1 year = 365 days) The life expectancy will be set at a set number for now but that will hopefully change. It will then take the life expectancy and minus your current age to tell you how many years you have left to live on all those planets.
