# _{Galatic_Calculator}_

#### A project practicing creating webpacks, classes, import/export features. Application will return age and life expectancy on other planets. 07/10/2020

#### By _**{Ryan Rendon}**_

## Description

This project will take an inputted age and calculate how old they are in years on other planets. A year will be defined as a full orbit around the sun (example earth: 1 year = 365 days.) The life expectancy will be a set number for now but that will hopefully change. It will then take the life expectancy and minus your current age to tell you how many years you have left to live on all of the planets. 

| Input       | Current Age                   | Life left    |
| ----------- | -----------                   | --------     |
| 24          | Mercury 99.54545454545455     | Mercury 199  |
|             | Venus 38.93333333333333       | Venus 77.86  |
|             | Earth 24                      | Earth  48    |
|             | Mars 12.751091703056769       | Mars 25.502  |
